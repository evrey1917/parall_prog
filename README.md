<h1>Integral of sinus in [0; 2pi]</h1>

<h2>With Makefile</h2>

<h3>Double</h3>

If you want answer in double, write in console:

```
bash m_double.bash
```

<h3>Float</h3>

If you want answer in float, write in console:

```
bash m_float.bash
```

<h3>EXE-file</h3>

Name: m_sin_sum
Place: directory with sin_sum.cpp

<h2>Result</h2>

    double sum of sinus in [0; 2pi]: 6.28364e-07
    double sum of sinus in [0; 2pi] from array: 6.28364e-07

    float sum of sinus in [0; 2pi]: 0.267542
    float sum of sinus in [0; 2pi] from array: 0.267542
